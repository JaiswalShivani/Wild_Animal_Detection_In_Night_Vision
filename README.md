# Wild_Animal_Detection_In_Night_Vision_with_siren
This project is an attempt to develop Wild Animal Detection (night vision) with siren using modern computer vision technology.It involved the inclusion of Yolov5.

Pre-requisites - 
●	Python
●	Basics of Deep Learning
●	Computer Vision
●	Yolov5

Dependencies - 
●	Python
●	Yolov5
●	Pytorch
●	Roboflow
●	OpenCv
●	Numpy
●	Pandas
●	Seaborn
●	Matplotlib
●	Tqdm
●	Cuda

Folders - 
1.	Create a folder which contains all the images with their annotated file. This folder we have to upload on roboflow while creating the dataset.
2.	Create an account on roboflow then create a dataset on which we will upload the above mentioned folder.

File Description - 
1. best.pt - Weights file.
2. yolo.py - Detection model file contain code of detecting animal in a input image as well as webcam.
3. Wild_Animal_Detection_YOLOv5.ipynb - Yolov5 model building.
4. Siren_edit.wav - Siren music.
5. Documentation - Contain detailed flow and process of whole project.Below is brief of flow.
Brief Description - This project is an attempt to develop Wild Animal Detection (night vision) using modern computer vision technology.It involved the inclusion of Yolov5.
